// The representation of a DBImpl consists of a set of Versions.  The
// newest version is called "current".  Older versions may be kept
// around to provide a consistent view to live iterators.
//
// Each Version keeps track of a set of Table files per level.  The
// entire set of versions is maintained in a VersionSet.
//
// Version,VersionSet are thread-compatible, but require external
// synchronization on all accesses.
